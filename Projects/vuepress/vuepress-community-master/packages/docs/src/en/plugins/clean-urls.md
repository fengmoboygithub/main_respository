# vuepress-plugin-clean-urls <GitHubLink repo="vuepress/vuepress-community"/>

Provides support for clean urls in your VuePress site.

::: warning
This plugin will always work on your dev server, but VuePress **does not have the right** to modify server identification. If you want your URLs to follow a certain pattern (e.g. `/routing` instead of `/routing.html` or `routing/`), you should make sure that your server would treat it as an HTML. This means that you may need to configure your server specifically.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -D vuepress-plugin-clean-urls
```

## Usage

```js
// .vuepress/config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      'vuepress-plugin-clean-urls',
      {
        normalSuffix: '/',
        indexSuffix: '/',
        notFoundPath: '/404.html',
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

## Configs

### normalSuffix

- **type:** `string`
- **default:** `'/'`

The suffix for normal pages. For example, `foo/bar.md` will become:

- `foo/bar.html` by default (without this plugin)
- `foo/bar/` (with `normalSuffix` set to `'/'`)
- `foo/bar` (with `normalSuffix` set to `''`)

### indexSuffix

- **type:** `string`
- **default:** `'/'`

The suffix for index pages. For example, `foo/index.md` will become:

- `foo/` by default (without this plugin)
- `foo` (with `indexSuffix` set to `''`)
- `foo/index.html` (with `indexSuffix` set to `'/index.html'`)

::: tip
An index page is a page with a file name of `index.md` or `readme.md` (case insensitive).
:::

### notFoundPath

- **type:** `string`
- **default:** `'/404.html'`

URL for "404 not found" page.
